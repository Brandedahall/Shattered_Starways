# Shattered_Starways

This is the Roguelike conversion of my TableTop RPG of the same name. It is currently being created in Python, using tcod as the renderer and Esper for the ECS framework.

tcod: https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod
Esper: https://github.com/benmoran56/esper

The game will be updated slowly while I improve my skills. It is my first time properly using an ECS.

The goal for this game is to be a fun and engaging Rogue-like experience set within the far-off future. The majority of the tools used within newer rogue-likes will be included, such as pathfinding, glow-lighting and custom sprites.
